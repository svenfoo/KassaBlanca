== README

This is a simple cashier system that we wrote for and used successfully
on an event with about a thousand visitors.

It allows to easily validate tickets that have been sold before and
keeps track of the number of visitors that have checked in over the
course of the day.


To get all the dependencies (and probably some more) installed run
    bundle install

Create some test data to get started:
    rake KassaBlanca:add_fake_data

Start the application:
    rails server
